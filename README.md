# About the Project

## The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building robust, scalable, and secure RESTful APIs and backend services.
- **PostgreSQL**: An advanced open-source relational database system for storing and managing application data securely and efficiently.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that enables flexible and efficient data retrieval between the frontend and backend.
- **JavaScript/React**: Used for building dynamic, responsive, and interactive user interfaces on the frontend.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform to package and deploy the application consistently across different environments.
- **Nginx**: A web server and reverse proxy used for serving static files, load balancing, and improving application performance.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration tools for managing source code and team contributions.
